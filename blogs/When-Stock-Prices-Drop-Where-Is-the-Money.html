        <h2>When Stock Prices Drop, Where Is the Money?</h2>
        </p><br>
        <p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"> Have you ever wondered what happened to your socks when you put them in the dryer and never saw them again? It's an unexplained mystery that may never be solved.
        </p>
        <p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"> Many people feel the same way when they suddenly find that their <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brokerageaccount.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" previewlistener="true">brokerage account</a> balance has taken a nosedive. Where did that money go?
        </p>
        <p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"> Fortunately, money that is gained or lost on a stock <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/lose-money-stock-market-crashes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" previewlistener="true">doesn't just disappear</a>. Read on to find out what happens to it.
        </p>

          <h3>Disappearing Money</h3>
            <p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"> Before we get to how money disappears, it is important to understand that regardless of whether the market is rising (a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" previewlistener="true">bull market</a>) or falling (a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" previewlistener="true">bear market</a>), <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supply.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3" previewlistener="true">supply</a> and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demand.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4" previewlistener="true">demand</a> drive the price of stocks. And it's the fluctuations in stock prices (and the points at which you buy and sell shares) that determine whether you make money or lose it.
            </p>
          <br>

            <h4>Buy and Sell Trades</h4>
              <p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"> If you purchase a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commonstock.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" previewlistener="true">stock</a> for $10 and sell it for only $5, you will lose $5 per share. You may believe that that money goes to someone else, but that isn't exactly true. It doesn't go to the person who buys the stock from you.
              </p>
              <p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"> For example, let's say you were thinking of buying a stock at $15, and before you do so, the stock price falls to $10 per share. You decide to purchase at $10, but you didn't gain the $5 depreciation in the stock price. Instead, you got the stock at the current market value of $10 per share.
              </p>
              <p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"> In your mind, you may think that you saved $5, but you didn't actually earn a $5 profit. However, if the stock then rises from $10 back to $15, you will have a $5 (unrealized) gain.
              </p>
              <p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"> The same is true if you're holding stock and its price drops, leading you to sell it for a loss. The person <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/04/052704.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" previewlistener="true">buying it at that lower price</a>—the price you sold it for—doesn't necessarily profit from your loss. That's because their entry point is the lower price and they must wait for the stock to rise above that level before making an unrealized (or realized) profit.
              </p>
            <br>

            <h4>Short Selling</h4>
              <p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"> There are investors who place trades with a broker to sell a stock at a perceived high price with the expectation that it will decline. This is called <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" previewlistener="true">short-selling</a>.
              </p>
              <p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"> If the stock price falls, the short seller profits by buying the stock at the lower price and closing out the trade. The net difference between the sale and buy prices is settled with the broker.
              </p>
              <p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"> Although short-sellers profit from a declining price, they're not taking money from you in particular when you lose on a stock sale. Rather, they're conducting independent transactions and have just as much of a chance to lose or be wrong on their trade as investors who are long (own) the stock.
              </p>
              <p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"> In other words, short-sellers profit on price declines, but it's a separate transaction from bullish investors who bought the stock and are losing money because the price is declining.
              </p>
            <br>
          
          <h3>Implicit and Explicit Value</h3>
              <h4>Implicit Value</h4>
                <p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"> On the one hand, value can be created or dissolved with the change in a stock's implicit value, which is determined by the personal perceptions and research of investors and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/analyst.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" previewlistener="true">analysts</a>.
                </p>
                <p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"> For example, a pharmaceutical company with the rights to the patent for the cure for cancer may have a much higher implicit value than that of a corner store.
                </p>
                <p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"> Depending on investors' perceptions and expectations for the stock, implicit value is based on revenues and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/06/earningsforecasts.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" previewlistener="true">earnings forecasts</a>.
                </p>
                <p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"> If the implicit value undergoes a change—which, really, is generated by abstract things like faith and emotion—the stock price follows. A <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/04/030504.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" previewlistener="true">decrease in implicit value</a>, for instance, leaves the owners of the stock with a loss in value because their asset is now worth less than its original price. Again, no one else necessarily receives the money; it simply vanishes due to investors' perceptions.
                </p>
              <br>

              <h4>Explicit Value</h4>
                <p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"> Now that we've covered the above somewhat unreal characteristic of money, we cannot ignore how money also represents explicit value, which is the concrete value of a company.
                </p>
                <p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"> Referred to as the accounting value (or <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bookvalue.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" previewlistener="true">book value</a>), the explicit value is calculated by adding up all <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" previewlistener="true">assets</a> and subtracting <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3" previewlistener="true">liabilities</a>. So, this represents the amount of money that would be left over if a company were to sell all of its assets at <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fairmarketvalue.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4" previewlistener="true">fair market value</a> and then pay off all of the liabilities, such as bills and debts.
                </p>
                <p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"> Without explicit value, the implicit value of the company would not exist. Investors' interpretation of the financial health and performance of a company is based on its explicit value. Explicit value is the force behind the stock's implicit value.
                </p>
              <br>

          <h3>Disappearing Trick Revealed</h3>
            <p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"> Let's say Cisco Systems Inc. (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=CSCO" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" previewlistener="true">CSCO</a>) had 5.81 billion shares outstanding. This means that if the value of the shares dropped by $1, the loss would be equivalent to more than $5.81 billion in (implicit) value.
            </p>
            <p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"> Because Cisco has many billions of dollars in concrete assets and makes profits, we know that the change occurs not in explicit value, so the idea of money disappearing into thin air ironically becomes much more tangible.
            </p>
          
          <h3>Should I Sell Stock If It Goes Down?</h3>
            <p>Unless there's something fundamentally wrong with the financials of the company whose stock you own (or you need the money), it may be worth waiting to see if the stock price reverses and recovers. Avoid panic selling.</p>
